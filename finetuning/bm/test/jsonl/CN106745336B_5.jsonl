{"text": "5. A method for preparing the lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide precursor according to any one of claims 1 to 4, comprising the steps of:\n(1) according to said NixCoyMnz(OH)2Preparing a soluble mixed salt water solution with the total concentration of metal ions being 1-2mol/l according to the molar ratio of metal elements in a chemical formula; preparing a strong alkali solution and ammonia water at the same time;\n(2) adding ammonia water into a reaction kettle to serve as reaction kettle bottom liquid, and then adjusting the pH value of the reaction kettle bottom liquid to 11-12 by adding strong base solution;\n(3) filling nitrogen into the reaction kettle obtained in the step (2), starting a stirring device, and controlling the output power of the stirring device to be 0.8-1.0 kw;\n(4) arranging feeding positions of the reaction kettle, enabling a feeding hole of a soluble mixed saline solution in the reaction kettle to be opposite to feeding holes of a strong base solution and ammonia water, combining the strong base solution and the ammonia water for feeding, and adding the prepared soluble mixed saline solution, the prepared strong base solution and the prepared ammonia water into the reaction kettle for stirring reaction; the pH value of the reaction system is controlled to be 11-12 in the reaction process;\n(5) with the continuous progress of the reaction feeding, the fine particles generated by the reaction grow gradually, the sphericity of the fine particles is improved gradually, after the reaction time is at least 10 hours, the unqualified materials at the early stage are circularly pumped into the reaction kettle, and the overflow materials are aged;\n(6) carrying out filter pressing after the aging is finished, and simultaneously adding an alkaline washing solution for washing;\n(7) and after the alkaline washing liquid is washed, washing with pure water until the pH value of the washing water is less than 10, drying, sieving and storing the washed materials.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 2006}

{"text": "1. The preparation method of the nickel-cobalt-manganese ternary precursor with low sulfur and high tap density is characterized by comprising the following steps of:\n1) preparing a mixed salt solution by using nickel, cobalt and manganese soluble salts as raw materials and pure water;\n2) adding a mixed salt solution, an alkali liquor and ammonia water into a reaction kettle, controlling the temperature, the rotating speed, the ammonia value, the residence time and the flow of protective gas, wherein the reaction is divided into a first stage with a high pH value and a second stage with a low pH value, the high pH value stage is mainly crystal nucleation, the low pH value stage is mainly crystal growth, the feeding is stopped after the low pH value stage reacts for a period of time, the stirring is stopped for a period of time for settling, when the supernatant is clarified, the supernatant is removed, the reaction is started for a period of time, and the reaction stopping, settling, supernatant extracting and reaction starting steps are repeated until the D50 of the slurry reaches a qualified range;\n3) washing the synthesized slurry for 1 time, 1-3 times and 1-3 times, then demagnetizing, drying and sieving to obtain the nickel-cobalt-manganese ternary precursor with low sulfur and high tap density; the prepared nickel-cobalt-manganese ternary precursor D50 is 6-13 mu m, TD is more than or equal to 2.30g/cc, and S content is less than or equal to 1200 ppm;\nin the step 2), the pH value of the high pH value stage is 11.50-12.50, the pH value of the low pH value stage is 10.4-11.30, the temperature is 45-60 â„ƒ, the rotating speed is 400-800rpm, the ammonia value is 3-8g/L, the retention time is 8-16h, and the protective gas flow is 60-200L/h;\nin the step 2), the feeding is stopped after the reaction is carried out for 10-15h at the low pH value stage, the stirring is stopped for settling after 0.1-1h, the supernatant is removed, and the reaction is started after 0.1-1 h.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 2002}

{"text": "1. A method for preparing transition metal composite hydroxide particles using a reactor having a closed structure, the method comprising:injecting raw materials comprising an aqueous solution of two or more transition metal salts and an aqueous solution of a complex-forming additive, and a basic aqueous solution for maintaining pH of an aqueous solution of the raw materials within a range of 10 to 12, into the rotation reaction area of the reactor through the inlet; andperforming coprecipitation reaction under a non-nitrogen atmosphere for 1 to 6 hours,wherein the reactor comprises:a stationary hollow cylinder;a rotary cylinder having the same axis as the stationary hollow cylinder and an outer diameter smaller than an inner diameter of the stationary hollow cylinder;an electric motor to generate power, enabling rotation of the rotary cylinder;a rotation reaction area disposed between the stationary hollow cylinder and the rotary cylinder, wherein ring-shaped vortex pairs that are uniformly arranged in a rotation axis direction and rotate in opposite directions are formed in the rotation reaction area; andan inlet through which a reactant fluid is fed into the rotation reaction area and an outlet through which the reactant fluid is discharged from the rotation reaction area,wherein a ratio of a distance between the stationary hollow cylinder and the rotary cylinder to the outer radius of the rotary cylinder is higher than 0.05 and lower than 0.4.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 1471}

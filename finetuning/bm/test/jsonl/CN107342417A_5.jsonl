{"text": "5. Claim 1-4 A high nickel type lithium manganate according to any one of method for producing a nickel-cobalt precursor, characterized in, including the steps of:\n(1) according to the NixCoyMnz(OH)2prepare a metal molar ratio of the metal element in the chemical formula ion concentration of 80-120 g/l aqueous solution of a soluble salt mixture; and prepares a strong alkali solution and aqueous ammonia;\n(2) a reaction vessel to a reaction vessel in the base liquid aqueous ammonia is added, and then adding a pH of the strong alkaline solution through the reaction tank residue is adjusted to not less than 12;\n(3) to the step (2) of the reaction vessel with a nitrogen gas, the mixing device is turned on;\n(4) mixing a soluble salt aqueous solution with the configured, a strong alkali solution, the reaction is carried out for a parallel flow of aqueous ammonia introduced into a reactor; pH of the reaction system during the reaction is controlled to not less than 12;\n(5) of the feed is continued as the reaction, the reaction product of the fine particles grow stepwise, spherical fine particles is gradually completed, after a period of time in the reaction, the reaction vessel into the circulating of the early fail, maturated overflow material;\n(6) after completion of the aging subjected to pressure filtration, washing liquid is added to an alkaline washing at the same time;\n(7) an alkaline washing liquid is completed, and then washing with pure water, until the wash water pH<10, and then drying the washed material, screening, it is possible to save.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 1569}

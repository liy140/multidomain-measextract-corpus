{"text": "1. A method for producing a transition metal composite oxide, comprising: a 1 st step of preparing a 1 st internal formation metal salt aqueous solution and a 2 nd internal formation metal salt aqueous solution containing nickel, cobalt, and manganese and having different concentrations of the nickel, cobalt, and manganese from each other; step 2, supplying a chelating agent and an aqueous alkali solution into the reactor; a 3 rd step of continuously supplying and mixing the 1 st interior-forming metal salt aqueous solution, the chelating agent, and the alkali aqueous solution to the reactor, and culturing particles having a fixed concentration of nickel, cobalt, and manganese and containing the 1 st interior having a radius of r1(0.2 um. ltoreq. r 1. ltoreq.5 um); and a 4 th step of mixing and supplying the 1 st inside forming metal salt aqueous solution and the 2 nd inside forming metal salt aqueous solution in a mixing ratio gradually changing from 100 v%: 0 v% to 0 v%: 100 v%, while mixing the chelating agent and the alkali aqueous solution into the reactor, to form particles containing the 2 nd inside having a radius r2(r2 â‰¦ 10um) in the 1 st inside profile, characterized in that,\nthe concentration of the alkaline aqueous solution added in the reactor in the 2 nd step is adjusted according to the nickel concentration of the particles produced in the 3 rd step before the 3 rd step, and the concentration of the alkaline aqueous solution of the reaction solution in the 2 nd step is adjusted to 0.25g/L to 0.5g/L so that the pH of the solution in the reactor in the 2 nd step is adjusted to 11.8 to 12.3.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 1630}

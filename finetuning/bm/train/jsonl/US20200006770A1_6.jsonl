{"text": "6. Transition metal composite hydroxide particles that are the precursor for cathode active material for a non-aqueous electrolyte rechargeable battery, comprising secondary particles that are formed by an aggregation of plate-shaped primary particles and fine primary particles that are smaller than the plate-shaped primary particles;\nthe secondary particles having a center section that is formed by an aggregation of the plate-shaped primary particles, and one layered structure of a low-density section that is formed by an aggregation of the fine primary particles and a high-density section that is formed by an aggregation of the plate-shaped primary particles on the outside of the center section;\nthe average value of the ratio of the center section outer diameter with respect to the particle size of the secondary particles being 30% to 80%, and the average value of the high-density section radial direction thickness with respect to the particle size of the secondary particles being 5% to 25%; and\nthe secondary particles having an average particle size of 1 μm to 15 μm, and an index [(d90−d10)/average particle size] that indicates the extent of the particle size distribution of 0.65 or less.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 1210}

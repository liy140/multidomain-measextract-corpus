{"text": "7. Transition metal composite hydroxide particles that are the precursor for cathode active material for a non-aqueous electrolyte rechargeable battery, comprising secondary particles that are formed by an aggregation of plate-shaped primary particles and fine primary particles that are smaller than the plate-shaped primary particles;\nthe secondary particles having a center section that is formed by an aggregation of plate-shaped primary particles, and two or more layered structure of a low-density section that is formed by an aggregation of the fine primary particles and a high-density section that is formed by an aggregation of the plate-shaped primary particles on the outside of the center section; and\nthe secondary particles having an average particle size of 1 μm to 15 μm, and an index [(d90−d10)/average particle size] that indicates the extent of the particle size distribution of 0.65 or less.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 912}

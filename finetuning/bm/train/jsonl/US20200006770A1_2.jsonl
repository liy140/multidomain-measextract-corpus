{"text": "2. A production method for producing transition metal composite hydroxide particles by a crystallization reaction to be a precursor for a cathode active material for a non-aqueous electrolyte rechargeable battery, comprising:\na nucleation process for performing nucleation by controlling an aqueous solution for nucleation that includes a metal compound that includes at least a transition metal and an ammonium ion donor so that the pH value at a standard liquid temperature of 25Â° C. becomes 12.0 to 14.0; and\na particle growth process for causing nuclei to grow by controlling an aqueous solution for particle growth that includes the nuclei that were obtained in the nucleation process so that the pH value is less than in the nucleation process and is 10.5 to 12.0;\nthe reaction atmosphere in the nucleation process and at the beginning of the particle growth process being a non-oxidizing atmosphere in which the oxygen concentration is 5% by volume or less;\nin the particle growth process, atmosphere control by which the reaction atmosphere is switched from the non-oxidizing atmosphere to an oxidizing atmosphere in which the oxygen concentration is greater than 5% by volume, and is then switched from that oxidizing atmosphere to a non-oxidizing atmosphere in which the oxygen concentration is 5% by volume or less being performed two times or more; and\nthe total crystallization reaction time in the oxidizing atmosphere in the particle growth process being 3% to 30% of the total particle growth process time, and the crystallization reaction time during each oxidizing atmosphere being 1% or more of the total particle growth process time.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 1653}

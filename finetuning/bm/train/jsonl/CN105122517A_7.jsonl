{"text": "7. Transition metal composite hydroxide particles which are precursors of positive electrode active materials for nonaqueous electrolyte secondary batteries, wherein,\nthe transition metal composite hydroxide particles are composed of a plurality of plate-like primary particles and secondary particles formed by aggregating fine primary particles smaller than the plate-like primary particles,\nthe secondary particles have a central portion formed by the aggregation of the plate-like primary particles, and have at least one layered structure formed by the lamination of a low-density portion formed by the aggregation of the fine primary particles and a high-density portion formed by the aggregation of the plate-like primary particles outside the central portion,\nthe secondary particles have an average particle diameter of 1 to 15 [ mu ] m, and the [ (d90-d 10)/average particle diameter ] as an index indicating the width of the particle size distribution is 0.65 or less.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 979}

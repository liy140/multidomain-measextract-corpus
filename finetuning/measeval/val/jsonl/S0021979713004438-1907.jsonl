{"text": "Since the substrate is a pre-conditioned iron surface that is not as stable as a model silica surface, the adsorption of Mefp-1 was interrupted after 10 min to prevent non-negligible corrosion of the substrate within the period of measurement.", "sentId": 6, "start": 665, "end": 908}

{"text": "As shown in Fig. 2, the exposure of the adsorbed layer to the FeCl3 solution leads to a decrease in the sensed mass, which can arise from removal of some loosely bound Mefp-1 and/or some of the coupled water in the protein layer.", "sentId": 8, "start": 1105, "end": 1334}

{"text": "Solar EUV heating is calculated through explicit line-of-sight integration of solar irradiance attenuation (the Lambert–Beer Law), assuming solar spectra derived from the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED)/Solar EUV Experiment (SEE) (Woods et al., 2005; Woods, 2008) and heating efficiencies of 50%, a value in agreement with estimates for Jupiter by Waite et al. (1983).", "sentId": 5, "start": 761, "end": 1164}

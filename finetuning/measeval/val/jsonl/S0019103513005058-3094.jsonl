{"text": "If the soil has been mixed by impact perturbations to a characteristic depth of ∼2 m during this time, given a time-average volcanic flux 0.1% of the modern terrestrial volcanic flux, the model suggests that the soil would have accumulated 1.0–1.7 wt.% SO42- and 0.2–0.4 wt.% N in the form of pernitrate (peroxynitrate) or nitrate.", "sentId": 5, "start": 788, "end": 1119}

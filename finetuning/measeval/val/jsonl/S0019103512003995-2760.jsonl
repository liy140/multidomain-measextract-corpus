{"text": "It is interesting to note that while the velocity structure of the escaping plasma can lead to broader absorption that helps to explain the transit depths, it is not necessarily detectable in the data.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 201}

{"text": "The velocity structure is not detectable because the optical depth of the high velocity material is not sufficient, the LOS velocity at the limb of the planet is slower than the radial velocities in general, and because spectral line broadening within the COS instrument smooths the structure out of the line profiles.", "sentId": 3, "start": 342, "end": 660}
{"text": "If the presence of velocity structure is confirmed in the data (Linsky et al., 2010), it probably implies that there is detached, optically thick plasma moving at large velocities around the planet.", "sentId": 4, "start": 661, "end": 859}
{"text": "If this turns out to be the case, interaction with the stellar wind probably plays a role in giving rise to the observed absorption.", "sentId": 5, "start": 860, "end": 992}

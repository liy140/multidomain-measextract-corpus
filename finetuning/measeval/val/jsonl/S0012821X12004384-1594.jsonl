{"text": "This scenario would be consistent with a gradual increase in the global hydrologic cycle before the CIE, perhaps from gradual warming, which was hypothesised to have triggered ocean circulation changes, methane hydrate destabilisation, and global carbon release at the CIE (Bice and Marotzke, 2002).", "sentId": 3, "start": 462, "end": 761}

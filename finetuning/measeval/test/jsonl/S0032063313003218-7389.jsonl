{"text": "We investigated the effect of transient variations in solar wind dynamic pressure on the Mâ€“I coupling currents, thermospheric flows, heating and cooling rates and aurora of the Jovian system.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 191}
{"text": "We considered two scenarios: (i) a transient compression event and (ii) a transient expansion event.", "sentId": 2, "start": 192, "end": 292}
{"text": "Both of these were imposed over a time scale of 3 h. A transient compression event consists of an initially expanded, steady-state magnetospheric configuration.", "sentId": 3, "start": 293, "end": 453}
{"text": "The model Jovian magnetosphere then encounters a shock in the solar wind, which compresses the system.", "sentId": 4, "start": 454, "end": 556}
{"text": "As the conceptual shock propagates past the magnetosphere, a rarefaction region follows and the magnetosphere subsequently expands back to its initial state.", "sentId": 5, "start": 557, "end": 714}
{"text": "The opposite occurs for our expansion event.", "sentId": 6, "start": 715, "end": 759}

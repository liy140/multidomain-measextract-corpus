{"text": "Epoxy polymers are a class of high-performance thermosetting polymers which are widely used for the matrices of fibre-reinforced composite materials and as adhesives.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 166}
{"text": "They are known for their excellent engineering properties, such as high modulus, low creep, high strength, and good thermal and dimensional stabilities.", "sentId": 2, "start": 167, "end": 319}
{"text": "However, epoxy polymers have inherently low toughness and impact resistance due to their highly crosslinked structure.", "sentId": 3, "start": 320, "end": 438}
{"text": "This structure leads to brittle behaviour and causes the polymers to suffer from relatively poor resistance to crack initiation and growth.", "sentId": 4, "start": 439, "end": 578}
{"text": "To improve the toughness of epoxy polymers, it has been established that the incorporation of a second micro-phase of a dispersed rubber, e.g. Refs.", "sentId": 5, "start": 579, "end": 727}

{"text": "[6–8], can increase the toughness.", "sentId": 7, "start": 773, "end": 807}
{"text": "Here the rubber or thermoplastic particles are typically about 0.1–5 μm in diameter with a volume fraction of about 5–20%.", "sentId": 8, "start": 808, "end": 930}
{"text": "The particles are typically well-dispersed, and formed by reaction-induced phase-separation.", "sentId": 9, "start": 931, "end": 1023}
{"text": "However, the particle size is difficult to control as it is dependent on the curing conditions, and hence cannot be varied systematically without changing the properties of the epoxy polymer.", "sentId": 10, "start": 1024, "end": 1215}

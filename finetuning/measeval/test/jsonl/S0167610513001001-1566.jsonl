{"text": "If the sonic anemometer is to be used to evaluate the accuracy of the lidar-measured wind speeds, confidence in the accuracy of the wind speeds measured by this instrument must be high.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 185}
{"text": "In a previous study Barlow et al. (2011b) carried out wind tunnel simulations of the flow around BT Tower and the lattice tower on which the anemometer is located.", "sentId": 2, "start": 186, "end": 349}
{"text": "During these simulations it was observed that both the tower and the lattice distorted the flow at the position of a sonic anemometer installed on top of the lattice, and correction factors were developed for this position.", "sentId": 3, "start": 350, "end": 573}
{"text": "These correction factors cannot be directly applied to the data presented here, as the sonic anemometer has been moved since the original installation.", "sentId": 4, "start": 574, "end": 725}
{"text": "Although the corrections applied by Barlow et al. (2011b) were small (â‰ˆ2% of the mean wind speed), data from the sonic anemometer are examined here to determine whether flow distortion has a substantial effect on the instrument in this new position.", "sentId": 5, "start": 726, "end": 975}
{"text": "Since the new position is higher, and therefore further from the lattice tower, it is expected that any error will be smaller.", "sentId": 6, "start": 976, "end": 1102}

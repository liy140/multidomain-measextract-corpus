{"text": "For the 1.5 mm beach the agreement between model predictions and measurements is quite good after t = 2 s. At the early stages of swash, however, there is a disagreement: the experimental results show an approximately constant gradient whereas the simulation results suggest a steep increase upon the bore arrival, followed by a gradual decline.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 345}
{"text": "At the initial stages of infiltration, when the height of surface water is much greater than the penetration depth, hydraulic gradients are expected to be higher than later on.", "sentId": 2, "start": 346, "end": 522}

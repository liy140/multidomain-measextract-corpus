{"text": "The agreement is poorer close to flow reversal, when the momentum balance method is least accurate because all balance terms are very small.", "sentId": 4, "start": 390, "end": 530}
{"text": "The Reynolds stress method agrees with the other two methods in the uprush, but in the backwash it produces results that lag behind them by up to 1 s. This delay is likely due to the same reason as that causing the delay in near-bed turbulent shear stress relative to the near-bed velocity, since the near-bed velocity is closely related to the bed shear stress.", "sentId": 5, "start": 531, "end": 893}

{"text": "Brace et al. (1982) observed that the ionopause was higher on the dawn side than at dusk due to interaction with the solar wind.", "sentId": 2, "start": 93, "end": 221}
{"text": "Miller and Knudsen (1987) reported larger antisunward velocities within the ionosphere on the dawn side than on the dusk side above an altitude of 400 km, with the pattern reversed below this altitude.", "sentId": 3, "start": 222, "end": 423}
{"text": "The dawn–dusk asymmetry below 400 km was largely attributed to photoionisation as plasma in the post-noon sector had been exposed to sunlight for longer than plasma in the pre-noon sector.", "sentId": 4, "start": 424, "end": 612}
{"text": "The plasma flow from the dayside to the nightside was driven by the day-to-night pressure gradient, with the higher plasma densities in the post-noon sector enhancing the nightward transport of ions on the dusk side.", "sentId": 5, "start": 613, "end": 829}
{"text": "The super-rotation of the neutral atmosphere also enhanced the ion flow on the dusk side and reduced the flow on the dawn side due to collisional interactions between the ions and the neutral species.", "sentId": 6, "start": 830, "end": 1030}
{"text": "A subsequent modelling study at the altitude of the peak density in the ionosphere (∼140 km) showed that differences in the thermospheric composition between the dawn and dusk sides may also cause asymmetries in the ionosphere at these altitudes due to changes in the dominant chemical reactions (Fox and Kasprzak, 2007).", "sentId": 7, "start": 1031, "end": 1352}

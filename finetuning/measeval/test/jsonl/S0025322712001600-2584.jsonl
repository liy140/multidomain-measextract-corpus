{"text": "In order to assess whether clay mineralogy relates to provenance in this setting we compared the smectite/(chlorite + illite), smectite/kaolinite and kaolinite/illite with the neodymium isotope characteristics of the sediments because this isotope system is widely accepted as a reliable provenance proxy that is not affected significantly by chemical weathering (Goldstein et al., 1984) (Fig. 10).", "sentId": 2, "start": 93, "end": 491}

{"text": "The combined estimate of ion drag and Joule heating rates increased from 67 mW m−2 (on September 8) to 277 mW m−2 (on September 11) resulting from a doubling of the ionospheric electric field (inferred from spectroscopic observations); this increase in heating was able to account for the observed rise in temperature.", "sentId": 2, "start": 268, "end": 586}
{"text": "Cooling rates (by hydrocarbons and H3+ emission) also increased during the event but only by ~20% of the total inferred heating rate.", "sentId": 3, "start": 587, "end": 720}

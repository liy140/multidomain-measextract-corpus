{"text": "A transient magnetospheric expansion event creates a significant increase in both power dissipated in the atmosphere due to Joule heating (~6× that of ES) and ion drag energy (~3× that of ES).", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 192}

{"text": "For case EF, where we now have the magnetosphere rotating faster than the thermosphere, there is a ~75% decrease in the magnitude of ‘magnetospheric’ power.", "sentId": 5, "start": 564, "end": 720}
{"text": "The magnetosphere is thus transferring power to the thermosphere in this case, albeit a relatively small amount.", "sentId": 6, "start": 721, "end": 833}

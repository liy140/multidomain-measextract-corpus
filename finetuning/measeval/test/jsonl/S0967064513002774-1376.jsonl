{"text": "Chambers were filled with tank seawater and corals were allowed to acclimate to the conditions for 2 h. Ten chambers were used per treatment at each time point; 8 for respiration, and 2 as seawater ‘blanks’ in order to measure (and subsequently subtract) background microbial respiration.", "sentId": 3, "start": 312, "end": 600}

{"text": "The line style code and labels are the same as in Fig. 6(a), the latitudinal size of a HST ACS-SBC pixel is indicated by the dark grey rectangle and the grey solid line indicates the limit of present HST detectability (~1kR; Cowley et al., 2007).", "sentId": 3, "start": 177, "end": 423}
{"text": "We begin by comparing profiles for case ES with EF, which are almost identical and both have maxima at ~74° latitude, equivalent to the location of the ‘main auroral oval’, and at ~80°, the boundary between open (region I) and closed field lines (region II).", "sentId": 4, "start": 424, "end": 682}
{"text": "Therefore, we would expect a fairly bright auroral oval of ~88kR for case ES and ~79kR for case EF.", "sentId": 5, "start": 683, "end": 782}
{"text": "The electron energy flux for case EF (~7.85mWm−2) is ~10% smaller than case ES (~8.8mWm−2) due to ΩT(ES)>ΩT(EF) leading to a smaller flow shear.", "sentId": 6, "start": 783, "end": 927}

{"text": "However, this region is strongly dependent on the plasma flow model used and poorly constrained by observations.", "sentId": 8, "start": 1055, "end": 1167}

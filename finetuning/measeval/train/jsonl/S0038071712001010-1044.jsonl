{"text": "A soil with a greater proportion of small pores (∼0.4 mm2) will retain water more effectively than a soil with larger pores; furthermore, small pores act as nutrient-rich habitats for soil microflora (Nunan et al., 2001).", "sentId": 4, "start": 577, "end": 798}

{"text": "Bearden (2001) concluded, in a study of soil–water characteristics, that AMF hyphae resulted in soils gaining groups of small pores which corroborates the current findings, although it is interesting that different Glomus species affect the size and distance between pores differently.", "sentId": 6, "start": 975, "end": 1260}

{"text": "In contrast, Milleret et al. (2009) found no evidence of G. intraradices forming small diameter structural pores and the larger size of the pores relative to the AMF led them to conclude that pore development was an indirect effect of the mycorrhiza.", "sentId": 8, "start": 1375, "end": 1625}
{"text": "Since the extraradical hyphae had a smaller diameter than the pores, the authors suggested that hyphal penetration of pores induced root exudation and increased microbial activity.", "sentId": 9, "start": 1626, "end": 1806}
{"text": "The data in the current investigation show that plant roots, possibly by influencing the associated microbial biomass and not colonisation by AMF per se, positively affected aggregate stability.", "sentId": 10, "start": 1807, "end": 2001}

{"text": "No correlations were observed for AMF hyphal abundance and soil physical properties, demonstrating that the differences observed may relate to growth patterns and mycelium architecture rather than density, or perhaps to AMF-specific altered C-exudation since AM fungi are known to produce extracellular soil proteins such as glomalin (Wright and Upadhyaya, 1996).", "sentId": 17, "start": 3206, "end": 3569}

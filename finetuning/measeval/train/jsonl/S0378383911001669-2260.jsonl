{"text": "(For reference, friction factors calculated assuming steady and uniform flow and evaluated from the measured depths and velocities, with equivalent roughness of 1.3 mm and 8.4 mm, are consistently higher for the rougher beach by approximately 50%.) The fact that the friction factors are not very different in the present experiments suggests that the high flow unsteadiness and non-uniformity of swash have significant influence on the bed shear stress for a given instantaneous velocity.", "sentId": 3, "start": 216, "end": 705}

{"text": "This method utilises the combined colloidal and flexible chemical nature of a porous polysaccharide (i.e. starch) gel to limit CdS growth.", "sentId": 2, "start": 109, "end": 247}
{"text": "The resulting hybrid gels can be dried to produce CdS/starch materials with high surface areas, predominantly mesoporous characteristics and scope for high CdS loading.", "sentId": 3, "start": 248, "end": 416}
{"text": "The synthesis is conducted in aqueous alcoholic solutions without the need for expensive preparation techniques or additional protection/templating strategies.", "sentId": 4, "start": 417, "end": 576}
{"text": "Materials were prepared at increasing CdS loadings on the starch gel, which confined nanoparticle growth and directed size/surface coverage, dispersion and UV–vis absorption profile.", "sentId": 5, "start": 577, "end": 759}
{"text": "The resulting powders presented large mesopore domains with high volumes (pore diameters > 10 nm; Vmeso > 0.5 cm3 g−1) and surface areas (SBET > 170 m2 g−1), interestingly effectively increasing with CdS loading.", "sentId": 6, "start": 760, "end": 972}
{"text": "The synthesised CdS nanoparticles were characterised in the 5–40 nm range of a cubic crystalline structure, increasing in size with loading.", "sentId": 7, "start": 973, "end": 1113}
{"text": "A complete surface coverage of the starch gel structure occurs at a CdS/starch ratio = 1 (w/w), allowing the synthesis of a unique mesoporous CdS/polysaccharide hybrid.", "sentId": 8, "start": 1114, "end": 1282}
{"text": "The presented route is simple, green and in principle extendable to a wide range of QDs and polysaccharide gels, whereby the porous polysaccharide gel acts as the deposition point of Cd2+, directing and stabilising both the growth of the inorganic CdS phase and the expanded high surface area polysaccharide form.", "sentId": 9, "start": 1283, "end": 1596}

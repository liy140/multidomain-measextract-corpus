{"text": "The performance and morphology of vacuum co-deposited BHJs was studied through variation of four main parameters—active layer thickness, polymer–fullerene composition and post-production thermal annealing temperature and time.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 226}
{"text": "In order to see the effect of annealing on different PTh:C60 compositions, optimization of the annealing temperature and time had to be performed.", "sentId": 2, "start": 227, "end": 373}
{"text": "A series of initial experiments indicated that BHJ with 80 vol% of C60 and a thickness of 70 nm lead to device characteristics comparable to the previously reported planar heterojunction devices (Jsc∼2–3 mA/cm2 and Voc∼0.40–0.45 V) [37].", "sentId": 3, "start": 374, "end": 611}
{"text": "This composition thus served as a good standard for optimization of the annealing parameters.", "sentId": 4, "start": 612, "end": 705}

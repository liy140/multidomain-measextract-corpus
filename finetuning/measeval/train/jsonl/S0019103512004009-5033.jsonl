{"text": "This is why the temperature at the 30 nbar level in the C2 model is 3800 K and not 1000 K. In order to test the effect of higher temperatures in the lower thermosphere, we extended the MC09 model to p0 = 1 μbar (with T0 = 1300 K) and again used the full solar spectrum for heating and ionization.", "sentId": 4, "start": 345, "end": 641}

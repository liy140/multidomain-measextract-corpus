{"text": "In solid-state, mutarotation is more difficult and the negative band at the 260 nm nearby can be detected which indicates that the GMP ligand is mainly β-anomers.", "sentId": 4, "start": 380, "end": 542}
{"text": "In the spectrum of complex 1, the weak negative band at 215–225 nm indicates that the GMP exists as l-ribo [5], which is induced by the strong π–π and hydrogen bonding interaction.", "sentId": 5, "start": 543, "end": 723}

{"text": "The strong negative CE centered at 297 nm (θ ≈ − 10 mdeg) is due to the excitation coupling of π → π* transitions of the aromatic chromophores, including the intra- and intermolecular coupling of the guanine chromophores [13], which is consistent with the single crystal structure.", "sentId": 7, "start": 860, "end": 1141}

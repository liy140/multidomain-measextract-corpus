{"text": "In the low wind speed case at wind frequencies of 0.01–0.03 Hz, the generator efficiency is higher with the reference strategy than with the other strategies, since strategies A–C operate at too high rotational velocities and thereby increase the already dominant core loss.", "sentId": 6, "start": 663, "end": 937}

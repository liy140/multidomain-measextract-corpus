{"text": "It is important to note that the divalent cation Cd2+ has an ionic radius of 0.097 nm [22], which leads to a number of speculative points; (1) the diameter of the cation is smaller than the internal cavity of the amylose helix (double or single; ca.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 249}

{"text": "As CdS nanoparticles grow and fill the porous domains as loading increases, the polysaccharide structure remains flexible, particularly in the presence of water (or water/alcohol mixtures), and the hydrogen bond network may then rearrange accordingly to accommodate the inorganic phase.", "sentId": 5, "start": 1176, "end": 1462}
{"text": "As the CdS clusters grow in size (and becoming increasingly crystalline) in the mesopores, the electrostatic repulsion increases the average pore size but with no reduction in surface area presumably as a consequence of an increased primary particle separation within the gel phase.", "sentId": 6, "start": 1463, "end": 1745}

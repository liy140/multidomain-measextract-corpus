{"text": "The 3DAP observation conditions were as follows: laser energy of 0.5–0.6 nJ, a laser-pulse repetition rate of 250 kHz, a DC bias voltage of 4–7 kV, and a specimen temperature of 55 K. The DC voltage was automatically controlled to keep a constant evaporation rate of 0.4% at constant energy of the laser pulse.", "sentId": 3, "start": 290, "end": 600}

{"text": "It is possible to explain such observations in general if we consider MEX to be above a region that has accelerated electrons upwards, in which case heavy-ions could also be accelerated downwards.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 196}
{"text": "This may explain the appearance of the very low DEF of heavy-ions at ∼400eV. However, due to the finite gyro-radius effect it is also plausible that the general behaviour of the heavy-ions flowing away from Mars may not change, even when passing an acceleration region.", "sentId": 2, "start": 197, "end": 466}
{"text": "The gyroradius of heavy-ions with energies around ∼10eV at the location of the accelerated electron signature is around 100 km, which is of a similar spatial scale to the horizontal size of a closed crustal magnetic field line at 400 km.", "sentId": 3, "start": 467, "end": 704}
{"text": "Therefore, it is possible the heavy-ions do not remain in the acceleration region long enough to experience its effects.", "sentId": 4, "start": 705, "end": 825}

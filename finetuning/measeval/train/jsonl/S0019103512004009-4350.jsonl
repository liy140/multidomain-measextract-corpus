{"text": "Compared to the C1 model, the maximum temperature in the C3 model is cooler by ∼1000 K and at high altitudes the C3 model is cooler by 1000–2000 K. The velocity is faster and hence adiabatic cooling is also more efficient.", "sentId": 5, "start": 436, "end": 658}
{"text": "The substellar tide drives supersonic escape (see also, Penz et al., 2008) and the sonic point in the C3 model is at a much lower altitude than in the C1 model (see Section 3.1.3).", "sentId": 6, "start": 659, "end": 839}

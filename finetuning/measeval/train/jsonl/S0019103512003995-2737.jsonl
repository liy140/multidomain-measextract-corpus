{"text": "In Paper I we noted that the stellar XUV flux, or the corresponding alternative heat source, would have to be 5–10 stronger than the average solar flux to produce a mean temperature between 8000 and 9000 K. Under such circumstances, the predicted transit depths in the C II and Si III lines would obviously be even higher than the values predicted by the SOL2 model.", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 366}
{"text": "Indeed, higher temperatures broaden absorption in the wings of the line profiles and may help to explain the in-transit flux differences better (see Fig. 7).", "sentId": 2, "start": 367, "end": 524}

{"text": "Also, mass loss rates of 109–1010 kg s−1 lead to the loss of 10–100% of the planet’s mass over the estimated lifetime of the system, and this probably limits reasonable energy inputs to less than ∼10 times the solar average on HD209458b.", "sentId": 5, "start": 787, "end": 1024}

{"text": "We present the first hydrodynamic escape model for the upper atmosphere that includes all of the detected species in order to explain their presence at high altitudes, and to further constrain the temperature and velocity profiles.", "sentId": 3, "start": 306, "end": 537}
{"text": "This model calculates the stellar heating rates based on recent estimates of photoelectron heating efficiencies, and includes the photochemistry of heavy atoms and ions in addition to hydrogen and helium.", "sentId": 4, "start": 538, "end": 742}

{"text": "We confirm that molecules dissociate near the 1 Î¼bar level, and find that complex molecular chemistry does not need to be included above this level.", "sentId": 6, "start": 871, "end": 1019}
{"text": "We also confirm that diffusive separation of the detected species does not occur because the heavy atoms and ions collide frequently with the rapidly escaping H and H+.", "sentId": 7, "start": 1020, "end": 1188}

{"text": "Our models predict an upper limit of 8000 K for the mean (pressure averaged) temperature below 3Rp, with a typical value of 7000 K based on the average solar XUV flux at 0.047 AU.", "sentId": 11, "start": 1654, "end": 1833}

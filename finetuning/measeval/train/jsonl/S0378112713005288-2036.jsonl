{"text": "Rowan is primarily dispersed through ingestion by birds, particularly various thrush species (Raspe et al., 2000), while oak relies on hoarding by both birds and mammals but especially Garrulus glandarius (jay) and Apodemus sylvaticus (wood mouse) (Forget et al., 2004), both of which occur at the study sites.", "sentId": 2, "start": 139, "end": 449}

{"text": "However, our findings are in contrast to previous work carried out in lowland sites in the UK that found positive relationships between the number of oak seedlings and distance to parent trees but no significant effect for birch seedlings (Harmer et al., 2005), possibly indicating differences between the shelterwood examined by Harmer et al. (2005) and the more extensive clearfells that we considered.", "sentId": 5, "start": 762, "end": 1166}

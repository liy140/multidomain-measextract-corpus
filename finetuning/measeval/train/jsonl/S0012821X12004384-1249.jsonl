{"text": "Borehole 22/10a-4 (57°44’8.47”N; 1°50’26.59”E) provides a continuous core through the Forties Sandstone Member and into the Lista Formation (Fig. 2).", "sentId": 1, "start": 0, "end": 149}
{"text": "The core consists of variably fissile claystone with interbedded fine to coarse grained sandstone layers interpreted as turbidites, with occasional mm-thick ash layers (Fig. 3).", "sentId": 2, "start": 150, "end": 327}
{"text": "All samples in this study were taken from claystone horizons to avoid sampling substantial quantities of reworked material.", "sentId": 3, "start": 328, "end": 451}
{"text": "The section of 22/10a-4 analysed in this study is from 2605 m to 2634 m (core depth), chosen because this part of the core is predominantly in claystone facies and provides a greatly expanded section over the onset of the CIE (Figs. 2 and 3).", "sentId": 4, "start": 452, "end": 694}
{"text": "At 2609–2613 m the claystone becomes finely laminated with alternately pale and dark laminae couplets ranging from 1 to 25 per mm (Fig. S2).", "sentId": 5, "start": 695, "end": 835}
{"text": "The pale laminae consist of clay and silt, and the dark laminae are rich in organic carbon and pyrite inclusions.", "sentId": 6, "start": 836, "end": 949}
{"text": "Laminae were counted at 26 horizons throughout the core and approximately 13 pairs per mm.", "sentId": 7, "start": 950, "end": 1040}

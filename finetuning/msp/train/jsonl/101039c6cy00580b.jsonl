{"text": "Typically, 16 g of urea was placed into a 50 mL alumina crucible with a cover and was heated in air at a rate of 15 degC min-1 to reach 550 degC. After being heated at 550 degC for 2 h, the obtained g-C3N4 was well ground in an agate mortar and was denoted as C3N4 in various characteristic figures below.", "sentId": 3, "start": 215, "end": 520}
{"text": "To prepare C3N4-Pd composites, 1.0 g of the as-prepared g-C3N4 was added into 100 mL of ethanol and was sonicated for 2 h to obtain thin g-C3N4 nanosheets.", "sentId": 4, "start": 521, "end": 676}
{"text": "The resultant was dried at 60 degC. Then, 1 g of the dried thin g-C3N4 nanosheets was added into 100 mL of H2O and was kept stirring for 30 min.", "sentId": 5, "start": 677, "end": 821}
{"text": "Then, an appropriate amount of Pd(NO3)2 dissolved in 30 mL of H2O was added dropwise into the above suspension.", "sentId": 6, "start": 822, "end": 933}
{"text": "Next, a certain amount of NaBH4 (according to the molar ratio of n(Pd(NO3)2):n(NaBH4) = 1:5) dissolved in 30 mL of H2O was added into the above suspension.", "sentId": 7, "start": 934, "end": 1089}
{"text": "After stirring for 10 min, the resulted suspension was aged for 2 h.", "sentId": 8, "start": 1090, "end": 1158}
{"text": "Finally, the resulted grey products were collected by filtration, washed with water and ethanol four times and dried at 60 degC to obtain the final products.", "sentId": 9, "start": 1159, "end": 1316}

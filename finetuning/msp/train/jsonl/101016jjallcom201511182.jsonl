{"text": "The syntheses were carried out to produce 0.75 g of the product.", "sentId": 2, "start": 157, "end": 221}
{"text": "NH4F (50% excess) was dissolved in 25 mL of water (solution A).", "sentId": 4, "start": 278, "end": 341}
{"text": "An aqueous solution B was prepared that contained Ln(NO3)3 and CeCl3 which were mixed at the desired molar ratio (0.01 Sm(NO3)3, 0.15 Gd(NO3)3 and 0.84 CeCl3 mol%), and diluted with water to make 100 mL. In the case of the products obtained in the presence of EDTA and citric acid, 0.5 wt.% of the desired polycarboxylic acid was additionally dissolved in solutions A and B. The pH of the systems was adjusted to [?]7, by the use of an aqueous NaOH solution.", "sentId": 5, "start": 342, "end": 800}

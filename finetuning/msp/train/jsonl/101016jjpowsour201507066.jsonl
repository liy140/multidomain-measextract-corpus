{"text": "\n\nTo prepare the Si-containing liquid precursor, 19 g of polymethylhydrosiloxane (Aldrich) was mixed with 1 g of divinyl polydimethylsiloxane (Aldrich) and 0.25 g of a catalyst solution (1wt.% hydrogen hexachloroplatinate in isopropyl alcohol), and the resulting mixture was heated at 70 degC for 2 h. Graphitic flake (GF; KS6, Timcal) powder, which consisted of flakes having an average particle size of 3 Î¼m (vender's value) and thicknesses ranging from 50 to 100 nm, was added into the liquid precursor and stirred for 1 h.", "sentId": 2, "start": 264, "end": 790}

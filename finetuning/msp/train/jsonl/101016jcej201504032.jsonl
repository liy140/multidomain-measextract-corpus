{"text": "The resulting solution was cooled to room temperature and the green precipitate that formed was washed with 3 x 20 mL of de-ionized water and dried under vacuum overnight at 50 degC. Finally, the precursors were calcined at 450 degC for 90 min in a muffle furnace under air atmosphere to obtain the nanocrystalline Cu/ZnO powder.", "sentId": 16, "start": 1702, "end": 2031}

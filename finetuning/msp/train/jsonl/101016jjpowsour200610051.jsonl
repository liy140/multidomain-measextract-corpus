{"text": "\nThe preparation of Pt/C(b) was: first a mixture of the required quantity of the carbon support (Vulcan XC-72R activated carbon black) and glycol was agitated ultrasonically and the hexachloroplatinic acid solution was added into the mixture at a temperature of 85deg C then, the formic acid solution was added drop by drop to reduce H2PtCl6 at 85deg C for 1 h. Next, the slurry obtained was filtered and washed with triply distilled water until no Cl- was detected.", "sentId": 3, "start": 154, "end": 620}

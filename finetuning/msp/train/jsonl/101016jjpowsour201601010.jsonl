{"text": "Typically, CC substrates (W0S1002, Phychemi Company Limited) were cut into small pieces (1-2 cm2), and then cleaned by sonication sequentially in acetone and alcohol for 10 min, respectively.", "sentId": 2, "start": 217, "end": 408}
{"text": "The cleaned CC was then soaked in 0.0025 M zinc acetate dihydrate alcohol solution for 5 min and annealed in oven for 20 min at 300 degC to form a ZnO seed layer.", "sentId": 3, "start": 409, "end": 571}
